	RESULTS
	{
	default = Trace amounts of methane and hydrogen sulfide are detected in this sample, possible originating from the impactors responsible for nearby craters.
	default = Minor concentrations of hydrogen sulfide are detected in this core sample, a possible indication of geologic activity.
	default = This core sample has relatively high levels of methane, nitrogen dioxide, ethylene, and hydrogen cyanide, an interesting mix of chemicals.
	default = Several toxic heavy metals are detected in this core sample.
	default = This core sample contains relatively high concentrations of methane, a possible sign of ongoing organic activity.

	RESULTS
	{
	default = The loose powder coating the surface is readily burned off by the laser, but nothing of interest is discovered below.
	default = Significant concentrations of heavy metals are detected on the surface here.
	default = Trace concentrations of heavy metals are detected in the surface rock, suggesting ancient volcanic activity that brought up minerals from the inner regions of the planet.
	default = Scans of this region of the planet's surface reveal only abundant concentrations of silicates.
	default = The liquid vaporized by the laser contains a shockingly high concentration of toxic compounds.
